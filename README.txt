# CF No KSES on Import Plugin

## Description

Removes all KSES filtering (the stuff that removes dangerous tags) on import of posts/pages via WordPress' interface.  Several clients have JavaScript or CSS tags inside the content of their posts, and those tags would be stripped without this plugin being enabled.

**Ensure you absolutely trust the content that you're importing!**

## Usage

- Activate plugin
- Perform import as normal
- **IMPORTANT** Deactivate plugin (very important for security)
